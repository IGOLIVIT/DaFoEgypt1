# App Store Review Issues - Fixed

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Guideline 4.0 - Design (UI Crowding)**
**Problem**: Parts of the app's user interface were crowded, laid out, or displayed in a way that made it difficult to use the app when reviewed on iPhone 13 mini and iPad Air (5th generation).

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Responsive Typography**: Updated `EgyptianFonts` to scale based on device width
- ✅ **Dynamic Spacing**: Implemented device-specific spacing (smaller on iPhone 13 mini)
- ✅ **Adaptive Padding**: Reduced padding on smaller screens (16px vs 20px)
- ✅ **Responsive Button Sizes**: Buttons now scale appropriately for different screen sizes
- ✅ **Improved Tab Bar**: Tab icons and text scale based on device size

### 2. **Guideline 2.1 - Performance (App Completeness)**
**Problem**: The app exhibited bugs that would negatively impact users. Bug description: The app did not load its contents.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Fixed AppState Duplication**: Removed duplicate `AppState` creation in `MainTabView`
- ✅ **Added Loading Screen**: Implemented proper loading state to prevent blank screens
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for data loading
